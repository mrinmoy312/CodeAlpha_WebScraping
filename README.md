## Objective

To scrape product data (book titles, prices, and ratings) from a public website and convert it into a structured tabular format (CSV) for further analysis.

This updated version includes web navigation by scraping multiple paginated pages (page 1 to 5) from the website, showcasing the ability to handle both HTML structure and page navigation.

## Website Scraped

- URL: http://books.toscrape.com  
- Purpose: Practice site for web scraping projects

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3
- requests
- BeautifulSoup (from bs4)
- pandas

## Extracted Features

Each row in the dataset contains:
- Book Title
- Price (in £)
- Rating (1 to 5, converted from class name)

The script iterates through multiple pages of book listings to collect a larger dataset.

## Sample Output (CSV Preview)

| Title                | Price (£) | Rating |
